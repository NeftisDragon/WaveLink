Hello!

This website is just a project for an online course I am doing.
Needless to mention that WaveLink is not a real company and that attempting to submit any formularies found within the website will not work.

I hope you like it. The responsive design isn't 100% accurate but it is enough to pass the course with a decent grade.

Cheers!
